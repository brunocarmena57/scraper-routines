During my time at Bank Sicredi, I was involved in developing and maintaining automation scripts. After carefully removing any sensitive data, I was able to share this repository publicly.

As I was honing my skills in Python automation, I prioritized writing modular, maintainable code and ensuring that the overall project was well-structured.

The scripts tackle a range of tasks, such as:

🔄 Data synchronization: automating data transfers between different systems, ensuring synchronization and consistency across platforms <br/>
📊 Report generation: automating the creation of reports from raw data, formatting them, and integrating with external tools for further analysis<br/>
🔐 Security tasks: automating routine security procedures, managing access controls, and ensuring compliance with data protection policies<br/>

The repository houses a collection of Python scripts focused on automation, utilizing a variety of libraries including openpyxl, pyautogui, and Selenium, among others.

Although the code could be further optimized and improved, this project was an invaluable experience, particularly in terms of enhancing workflows and ensuring secure and reliable automation processes.
